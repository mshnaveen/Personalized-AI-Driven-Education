# Personalized-AI-Driven-Education
Overview of Project ☁️

In this first project, we'll be using PartyRock to develop a 'Daily Task Scheduler Application' aimed at enhancing our productivity and organization. For those not familiar with PartyRock, it's a new platform offered by AWS designed to simplify app development through the use of generative AI. I've had a lot of fun playing around with PartyRock recently, so I hope you'll also enjoy building this project.

In the next few lessons, we'll be going through the following steps.

Generating the daily task scheduler application
Changes in existing widgets
Adding new widgets
Publishing your app
